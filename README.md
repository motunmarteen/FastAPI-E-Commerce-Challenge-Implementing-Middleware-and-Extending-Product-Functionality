## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of an E-Commerce API using FastAPI, along with additional features and endpoints as part of a challenge assignment.

## Features Implemented
1. **Unique Username Dependency**: Implemented a dependency to ensure that usernames are unique when creating a customer.
2. **Edit Customers Endpoint**: Added an endpoint to edit customer information.
3. **Edit Product Information Endpoint**: Added an endpoint to edit product information.
4. **Status Attribute for Orders**: Added a status attribute to the Order entity with a default value of "pending".
5. **Checkout Order Endpoint**: Implemented an endpoint to change the status of an order from "pending" to "completed".

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the main FastAPI application setup and routing.
- `middleware.py`: Middleware for logging and error handling.
- `routers/`: Folder containing router modules for different entities.
  - `customer.py`: Router module for customer-related endpoints.
  - `product.py`: Router module for product-related endpoints.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

## Usage
